# Machine Learning Playlist Summarizer



## Project Overview

So, here’s the deal: this project is all about summarizing a whole YouTube playlist that dives into Machine Learning. Even if you're a complete beginner to programmation you can learn about this project from zero. 



The original playlist i used to create my project: [Machine Learning Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO_fdPEVlfKqMDNmCFzQISI2H_nJcEDJq&si=wZDqCQoAyo7f8qpP).



What we’re doing is taking all those programming tasks from the videos and replicating them in Jupyter Notebook format. This project can help you just by letting you use those programms to learn just how it works and not having to rewatch all the vidéo.

- notebooks/: This folder has all the neat Jupyter Notebooks that line up with each video in the playlist.

- README.md: It’s got the details about the project and how to make the most of it.



## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you’ve got everything installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher

- Jupyter Notebook



### Installation

Clone repository:

```sh

git clone https://github.com/your-username/machine-learning-playlist-summarizer.git

cd machine-learning-playlist-summarizer

```

Dependencies installations:

```sh

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Create a Jupyter Noebook:

```sh

jupyter notebook

```

Open the notebook 



## What did i used

- Python: This is the main coding language we’re using.

- Jupyter Notebook: Perfect for interactive coding.

- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib: These are the tools for data processing and visualization.

- Scikit-learn: This is where the actual machine learning magic happens.



## Objectives 

- Summarizing each video's into Jupyter Notebooks.

- Letting you learn step by step without watching content again and again.

- Introducing people to Machine Learning even if they're total beginners.
